# skglm

## A fast :zap: and modular :hammer_and_pick: scikit-learn replacement for sparse GLMs

</section>


- introduce ``skglm`` 
- what is the problem we address
- why using ``skglm`` instead of scikit-learn
- what are the value brought by ``skglm``
- what we offer


some terms:
- datafit: ensure model data fidelity 
- penalty: enforce a sparse structure of the solution
- modularity: the ability to combine existing datafits and penalties
- extensibility: the ability to add support of new datafit and/or penalty


- Python package, 100% written in Python

- flexibility, high performance (up 100 times faster than scikit-learn)
- Sparse Generalized Linear Models
- Flexibility, myriad of models


- Large spectrum of problems: datafits, penalties
- Estimator compatible with scikit-learn API: ``.fit`` method, ``Pipelines``, ``GridSearchCV``
- high flexibility in adding new models
