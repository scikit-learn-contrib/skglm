Version 0.4 (in progress)
-------------------------
- Add :ref:`GroupLasso Estimator <skglm.GroupLasso>` (PR: :gh:`228`)
- Add support and tutorial for positive coefficients to :ref:`Group Lasso Penalty <skglm.penalties.WeightedGroupL2>` (PR: :gh:`221`)
- Check compatibility with datafit and penalty in solver (PR :gh:`137`)
- Add support to weight samples in the quadratic datafit :ref:`Weighted Quadratic Datafit <skglm.datafit.WeightedQuadratic>` (PR: :gh:`258`)


Version 0.3.1 (2023/12/21)
--------------------------
- Add support for weights and positive coefficients to :ref:`MCPRegression Estimator <skglm.MCPRegression>` (PR: :gh:`184`)
- Move solver specific computations from ``Datafit.initialize()`` to separate ``Datafit`` methods to ease ``Solver`` - ``Datafit`` compatibility check (PR: :gh:`192`)
- Add :ref:`LogSumPenalty <skglm.penalties.LogSumPenalty>` (PR: :gh:`#127`)
- Remove abstract methods in ``BaseDatafit`` and ``BasePenalty`` to make solver/penalty/datafit compatibility check easier (PR :gh:`#205`)
- Add fixed-point distance to build working sets in :ref:`ProxNewton <skglm.solvers.ProxNewton>` solver (:gh:`138`)
- Check compatibility between ``datafit + penalty`` and solver (PR :gh:`137`)
