skglm
========

skglm is a library that provide better sparse generalized linear model for scikit-learn.
Its main features are:

- **speed**: problems with millions of features can be solved in seconds. Default solvers rely on efficient coordinate descent with numba just in time compilation.
- **flexibility**: virtually any combination of datafit and penalty can be implemented in a few lines of code.
- **sklearn API**: all estimators are drop-in replacements for scikit-learn.
- **scope**: support for many missing models in scikit-learn - weighted Lasso, arbitrary group penalties, non convex sparse penalties, etc.

Installing the development version
----------------------------------
First clone the repository available at https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm::

    $ git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm.git
    $ cd skglm/

Then, install the package with::

    $ pip install -e .

To check if everything worked fine, you can do::
