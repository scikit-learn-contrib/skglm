class IterativeReweightedL1(GeneralizedLinearEstimator):
    r"""Reweighted L1-norm estimator.

    This estimator solves a non-convex problems by iteratively solving
    convex surrogates involving weighted L1 norms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    datafit : instance of BaseDatafit, optional
        Datafit. If None, ``datafit`` is initialized as a :class:`.Quadratic` datafit.
        ``datafit`` is replaced by a JIT-compiled instance when calling fit.

    penalty : instance of BasePenalty, optional
        Penalty. If None, `penalty` is initialized as a :class:`.L0_5` penalty.
        `penalty` is replaced by a JIT-compiled instance when calling fit.

    solver : instance of BaseSolver, optional
        Solver. If None, ``solver`` is initialized as an :class:`.AndersonCD` solver.

    n_reweights : int, optional
        Number of reweighting performed (convex surrogates solved).

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        Parameter vector (:math:`w` in the cost function formula).

    loss_history_ : list
        Objective history after every reweighting.
