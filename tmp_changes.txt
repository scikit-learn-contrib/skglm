## sample_weights
Sklearn comes with support to add weights for samples. These weights assign
importance to samples. For a dataset that contains very samples belonging to a
particular class the training algorithm must be made aware of the importance of
those samples to make sure the algorithm pays closer attention to them.

support for 'sample_weights' feature for Minimax Concave Penalty.
